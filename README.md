# Nodal_Analysis-
 Created a Python language based Data Visualization Project on Nodal Analysis (Sample Dataset was taken from Petrowiki).
The goal of this project was to analyze the behavior of oil and gas wells using nodal analysis. We focused on the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) and Tubing Performance Relationship (TPR) datasets for different tubing sizes.

Steps Taken:

Data Collection:
-Gathered IPR and TPR data from Petrowiki or other reliable sources.
-These datasets contain information related to flow rates, pressures, and other relevant parameters.
Data Conversion:
-Transformed the collected data into a structured pandas dataframe.
-Pandas provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis.
Visualization:
-Utilized the Matplotlib library to create a single graph combining IPR and TPR data.
-The resulting visualization allowed us to explore the nodal behavior of the well.
-By overlaying IPR and TPR curves, we gained insights into the wellâ€™s performance under varying conditions.
